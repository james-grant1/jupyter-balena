This repository contains episodes comprising 'Python on Balena', derived from material originally prepared by Roshan Mathew (rtm25@bath.ac.uk) suggesting good practise for running e.g. Anaconda and Juppyter notebooks on the University of Bath HPC service, Balena.

The lesson is prepared using nbfancy, the jupyter notebooks based build system developed by Jack Betteridge and James Grant for Advancing Research Computing at University of Bath.
